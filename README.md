#FINAL-PROJECT (DELIVERABLE 3)

1. Diagram out a class diagram of a User repository using Domain-Drive Design principles.  You can draw the class diagram with a PAINT application or on paper and then take a pic with your smartphone and submit that in the pull-request. **5 points**
**NOTE:** I would expect at least 4 *interfaces* with a minimum of 4 *concrete classes*.  Use *composition* over inheritance, if needed.
2. Implement the unit-tests for all new concrete classes. **5 points**
3. Implement code that makes all the unit-tests pass. **10 points**
